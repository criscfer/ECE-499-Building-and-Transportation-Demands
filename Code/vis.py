# Description:  This file hosts a visualization system for the data requested by user input.  
#               Generally, the independent variable will be time (in years). Examples of dependent
#               variables include demolition area, floor space, energy use intensity (EUI), and
#               residential and commerical space heating (SH) and water heating (WH). The pre-existing
#               types of visualizations include line, bar, and stacked bar charts, but implementation
#               is not limited to these types.
